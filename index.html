		<div id="about">
			<p>
				I am an engineer and researcher interested in high-performance numerical optimization and its
				applications to simulation, control, and robotics.
			</p>
			<p>
				I completed my PhD at <a class="four" href="http://stanford.edu">Stanford University</a>, working with <a
					class="four" href="http://zacmanchester.github.io/">Zachary Manchester</a> in the
				<a class="four" href="http://roboticexplorationlab.org/">Robotic Exploration Lab</a> on
				optimization-based tools for robotics applications including: simulation, planning, and control for
				drone coordination, legged locomotion, and dexterous manipulation.
			</p>
			<p>
				In industry, I worked as a research scientist intern at <a class="four" href="http://deepmind.com">DeepMind</a> with <a
					class="four" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CjOTm_4AAAAJ&hl=en">Yuval Tassa</a> where I led
				development of <a class="four" href="http://github.com/deepmind/mujoco_mpc">MuJoCo MPC</a>, an interactive tool for
				real-time robot behavior generation using predictive control that runs on a laptop. Prior to that I was a research
				intern
				at <a class="four" href="https://research.google/research-areas/robotics/">Google Brain</a> with <a class="four"
					href="https://vikas.sindhwani.org/">Vikas Sindhwani</a> working on planning with
				differentiable dynamical systems and related experiments with JAX. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As an undergraduate at the <a class="four" href="https://utah.edu">University of Utah</a>, I worked on: control for
				magnetically
				actuated microrobots and fabricated scaled swimmers for experimentation with <a class="four"
					href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h-GyeogAAAAJ&hl=en">Jake Abbott</a> at the <a class="four"
					href="https://www.telerobotics.utah.edu/index.php/">Telerobotics Lab</a>; wireless power transfer for aerial
				robots
				for my senior team project; developed mechatronics as part of a personalized
				medicine system for ovarian-cancer treatments with <a class="four"
					href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MFpS92oAAAAJ&hl=en">Bruce Gale</a> at the <a class="four"
					href="https://mems.utah.edu/">State
					of Utah Center of Excellence for Biomedical Microfluidics</a>. I
				also spent the summer after finishing my bachelor's degree sharing my love for programming and robotics by teaching
				kids
				at the <a class="four" href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~dejohnso/GREAT/">University of Utah GREAT camp</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				I love traveling (+35 countries so far!), films (anything from arthouse to romantic comedies to classics), coffee
				(always black), and sometimes I go for runs.
