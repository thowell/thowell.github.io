			<p>
				This project at the University of Utah was my first foray into mechatronics and programming. I wrote Matlab code that processed an image in order to determine the location of the target holes. The output was used as the input to Arduino C code I also wrote to determine and control where to position the launcher, at what angle to fire, how hard to shoot, and the reloading sequence. The hardware was provided as a kit with instructions for assembly. My partner on the project was key to dialing in the system once I had completed the code. During the competition we made 5/6 holes which was good enough to receive an automatic A on the final!
