					Sorting Rotating Micromachines by Variations in Their Magnetic Properties
				</p>

				<img src="../images/rolling_swimmers.gif" style="width:400px"></img>

				<p>
					We consider sorting for the broad class of micromachines (also known as microswimmers, microrobots,
					micropropellers, etc.) propelled by rotating magnetic fields. We present a control policy that capitalizes on
					the variation in magnetic properties between otherwise-homogeneous micromachines to enable the sorting
					of a select fraction of a group from the remainder and prescribe its net relative movement, using a uniform
					magnetic field that is applied equally to all micromachines. The method enables us to accomplish this
					sorting task using open-loop control, without relying on a structured environment or localization
					information of individual micromachines. With our method, the control time to perform the sort is
					invariant to the number of micromachines. The method is verified through simulations and scaled
					experiments. Finally, we include an extended discussion about the limitations of the method and address
					open questions related to its practical application.

				<div id="about">
					<p>
					I devised and implemented a control scheme to sort swarms of microrobots using rotating uniform magnetic fields for minimally invasive medical applications. This work included: applied physics, simulation, nonlinear optimization, fabrication of a scaled rolling-microrobot swarm, and writing <a class="four" href="https://github.com/thowell/helmholtzcoils">C++ code</a> to control a tri-axial Helmholtz-coil system.
